# Exercise 14: Base Advanced Features

## Overview

This exercise demonstrates advanced Base blockchain development concepts and patterns. Students will learn Base-specific features, network validation, and modern Solidity practices tailored for the Base ecosystem.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will learn:

1. **Base Network Validation** - How to validate deployment on Base mainnet (Chain ID: 8453)
2. **Base Constants** - Using Base-specific addresses and constants
3. **Modern Solidity Patterns** - Error handling, modifiers, and gas optimization
4. **Base Development Best Practices** - Following Base ecosystem standards
5. **Educational Contract Design** - Building contracts for learning purposes

## Contract Features

### BaseAdvancedFeatures.sol

The main contract includes:

- **Network Validation**: Ensures contract runs only on Base mainnet
- **Base Constants**: Uses real Base bridge address and chain ID
- **Exercise Tracking**: Manages student progress and scores
- **Gas Optimization**: Demonstrates efficient Solidity patterns
- **Event Logging**: Proper event emission for tracking

## Key Concepts

### Base Network Constants

```solidity
uint256 public constant BASE_CHAIN_ID = 8453;
address public constant BASE_BRIDGE = 0x3154Cf16ccdb4C6d922629664174b904d80F2C35;
```

### Network Validation

```solidity
modifier onlyBase() {
    if (block.chainid != BASE_CHAIN_ID) revert NotOnBaseNetwork();
    _;
}
```

### Exercise Completion

```solidity
function completeExercise(
    string calldata exerciseName,
    uint256 score
) external onlyBase {
    // Implementation
}
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Solidity ^0.8.19
- Base network access
- Understanding of previous Base Learn exercises

### Deployment

1. Ensure you're connected to Base mainnet
2. Deploy the contract using your preferred method
3. Verify the contract validates Base network correctly

### Testing

1. Call `validateBaseNetwork()` to confirm Base deployment
2. Complete exercises using `completeExercise()`
3. Check your progress with `getUserData()`

## Exercise Tasks

### Task 1: Network Validation
- Deploy the contract on Base mainnet
- Verify `validateBaseNetwork()` returns correct values

### Task 2: Exercise Completion
- Complete an exercise with a valid score (0-100)
- Verify your completion status

### Task 3: Data Retrieval
- Use `getUserData()` to get your exercise information
- Understand the returned data structure

## Advanced Topics

- **Gas Optimization**: Understanding efficient Solidity patterns
- **Error Handling**: Using custom errors vs require statements
- **Event Design**: Proper event indexing and data structure
- **Base Ecosystem**: Integration with Base infrastructure
